Growing up I was very interested in tech, mechanics, and really anything hands on. I wanted to build up old cars with my dad, work on technology with him, and really just work with my hands. Unfortunately, I never got the opportunity to do these things, so these interests were very surface level. 

As I got into high school, math and science were becoming very challenging and I found that it took me a long time to grasp certain concepts. None of it was coming to me naturally. I was very shy when I was younger, so I did not seek the help I needed while in school. Instead, I put myself in the "I am not smart enough for this" category. 

I decided early on that although I found these subjects to be the most fascinating, I just wouldn't be able to do them (add in a lot of high school girl confidence/self-esteem issues and you have one million mental blocks for why you can't do things). 

Because of this thinking, I ended up studying psychology and earned a degree in Clinical Psych with a minor in Biomedical Ethics. I do not regret going this route. It brought me to where I am today and I grew so much in college and the years following. 

After colllege, I moved to CO and started working for a generator company. I worked my way up to assistant service manager. Funny how I made my way into that field after trying to stay away from tech and mechanics. I met my now husband right before starting my job there. During that time, he was an applications engineer. Now he is an android platform software engineer. As you can probably tell, he sparked my interest even more (he also works on cars and we both have off-road jeeps we built up). He truly believes in my abilities and helped me get to where I am now.

To add on, I have BIG dreams for myself and my family.

I am currently a stay at home, work from home mother of 3. I work remotely for a health care company as a care coordinator in the evenings and on the weekends. I love the flexibility and that I have the ability to work from home. I took on this role when I knew I needed more; when I felt that I was not doing enough for myself.

I knew I needed more. I knew I needed to make some kind of income because that makes me feel accomplished. I enjoy contributing and I love working. There's this constant internal battle for me where I want to be home for my kids and I want a career. I want the best of both world's!

While I enjoy my current job and working in the healthcare industry, I still crave more!

I want to be challenged. I want to conquer my fears and anxieties around math and science. I want a career that offers flexibility and financial freedom. I want to show my kids that they can do ANYTHING that they put their minds to (and that it takes HARD work). I also would love to inspire others. 

This is not an easy path. This is the hardest thing I have signed up for (harder than pregnancy and child birth for sure!) I may or may not have already had a few mental breakdowns and cry-yelled at my husband, BUT I am all in.  I have a fire inside of me and I am going to do this! I am going to be a software engineer.
